# WebGPU Particles

This is a small project I made to learn about WebGPU; it uses point rendering and a compute shader to simulate millions of particles at realtime speeds. The particle simulation is derived from [this great blog post](https://dgerrells.com/blog/how-fast-is-javascript-simulating-20-000-000-particles).

## Installing
```sh
npm install
```

## Development
```sh
npm run dev
```

## Building

The built site goes into `dist/`.
